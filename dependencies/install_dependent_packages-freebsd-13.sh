# This script lists dependencies for running this repository's code base in a "baseline" FreeBSD 12 environment, where only these configurations were made after the first boot of a new system:
# * Installing 'pkg'.
# * Using 'pkg' to install packages 'git', 'sudo', and 'vim'.
#   - Note that 'vim' pulls in the package for Python 3.
# To run the tests, see the similar script ${top_srcdir}/tests/dependencies/install_dependent_packages-freebsd-12.sh.
